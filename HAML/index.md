haml
===

haml (HTML abstraction markup language) is a whitespace sensitive markup language. From their website:

> Beautiful, DRY,
well-indented, clear markup:
templating haiku.

Why important
---

We think haml better than erb, because the constraints of whitespace sensitivity lead to faster reading, and reading code is what the majority of our time is spent doing. Most importantly, we think it is good to know both haml and erb as you will likely run into both.

How we teach it
---

We start by having everyone use erb, since it is the default rails format.  However, once we move into more advanced topics, we introduce haml.  It's important to undertand both as you'll likely work on projects that use both erb and haml.
