From the [OAuth website](http://oauth.net/):

> An open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.

Why important

Many modern APIs such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, require OAuth for accessing and posting information on behalf of users.

How we teach it

You will utilize the Twitter API and OAuth to sign in as a Twitter user and post a status update on behalf of that user.

There is a [beginner's guide to OAuth](http://hueniverse.com/oauth/), but we actually don't recommend it unless you **really** want to learn more about OAuth.
