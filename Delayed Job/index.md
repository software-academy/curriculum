Some tasks (importing files, sending emails, etc) take a long time to process.  [Delayed Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) helps execute these tasks asycnronously in the background.

Most complex web applications have a need for asyschronous processing.  Delayed Job is the main gem used by the Ruby on Rails community for this functionality.


How we teach it

You will use Delayed Job to send emails in some of the sample projects.
