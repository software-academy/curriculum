SimpleCov
===

[SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) is a code coverage analysis tool for Ruby.  From their website:

> ...by providing a clean API to filter, group, merge, format and display those results, thus giving you a complete code coverage suite that can be set up with just a couple lines of code.


Why important
---

Knowing which lines of code aren't covered by tests gives developers some insight into where they can potentially spend useful time fleshing out more tests.  Code coverage also helps developers in the code refactoring process.


How we teach it
---

Each project will have SimpleCov as it is included in each project template.
