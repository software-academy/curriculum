[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is "CSS with superpowers" as they say.  It is a CSS extension language which includes variables, nesting, and mixins to make CSS easier to create and maintain.

Why important
---

Sass comes with Rails.  CSS extensions (LESS is another) improve our ability to create maintainable CSS and that is **very** important for large sites.


How we teach it
---

You'll be using SASS for some customization of several of the later projects in this course.
