JavaScript
===

JavaScript was introduced by Netscape in the mid 90's to be a lightweight, client-side programming language used in browsers.  Since that time, it has become the standard client-side language and has also gained traction as a server side langauge with implementations such as [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).


Why important
